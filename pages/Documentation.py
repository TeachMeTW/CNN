        - **Real-Time Metrics**: Displays defect rates, anomaly percentages, and total detected anomalies.  
        - **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and tables to explore anomaly patterns and distributions.  
        - **Uploading Data**: Allows CSV data upload to MongoDB for storage and analysis.  
        - **IoT AutoEncoder Tuning**: Users can train and update custom AutoEncoder models with adjustable hyperparameters.  
        - **Interactive Exploration**: Pygwalker integration for in-depth data exploration. Can select certain settings.

        "At the start of the project, Cisco provided us with a functional anomaly detection workflow utilizing AI and ML, "
        "which was limited to a Python environment. Our interactive dashboard builds on this foundation by automating the anomaly detection workflows "
        "and making them accessible through a user-friendly interface. No technical background is necessary to use the dashboard and see the results of the anomaly detection workflows "
        "The dashboard simplifies complex data analysis, improving usability, enhancing hardware reliability, and increasing operational efficiency."
